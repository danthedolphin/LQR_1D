# LQR_1D

The LQR can mathematically solve the next action a robot can take to return to the origin state. Here, the origin state is defined as position 0, velocity 0. 

We can use the Discrete-Time Algebraic Ricatti Equation to help solve this.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_Riccati_equation
